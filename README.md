# SSRandlyaps_of_C_Elegans
We perform delay embedding and dimension reduction on the datasets of the neuronal activity of the C Elegans worm. We analyze the dynamics of the reconstructed state space, estimating its Jacobian and calculating its Lyapunov exponents. The Lorenz system and another dataset of the C Elegans neuronal activity are used as examples.
